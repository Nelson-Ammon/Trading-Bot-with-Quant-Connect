# Overview

Ther purpose of this project was to bring together my love of computer science and looking at the stock market. So i decided to make a bot that trades for me! 

The software that i wrote is a bot that trades for you. The utility of this bot is it will monitor the price of the asset that you have invested in. It sets a stop loss on the asset so if the asset drops 5% then it will sell out for you. But if the asset goes up it wont sell until it drops 5% from the current price. 
So if the asset appreciates 15% and then drops 5% then you made 10% off that trade. 

My big purpose of doing this bot was to learn about how trading bots work. I also really enjoy trading myself so it was a fun project to bring together a passion in computer science and in markets.

# Development Environment

I used Quant Connects website that has a built in API and it made it really easy to learn and figure out how to code a working bot. The challenge now is learning market indicators and figuring out that data that you want to feed the bot to make it good.

# Useful Websites

* [Quant Connect ](https://www.quantconnect.com/)
* [Trading Strategies](hhttps://www.tradingview.com/scripts/?script_type=strategies)

# Future Work

* Make a better bot that takes in more dataa to make a better decison.
* Backtest the bot with various assets 
* Change the bot to trade on a shorter time frame.
